-- I read and accept the submission rules and the extra rules specified in each question. This is my own work that is done by myself only.


--this is my definition of data familytree which will take name childnum (birth,death) and create tree out of it, maximum 3 nodes(it would be easier if it was [familytree])

data FamilyTree = EmptyTree | Node [Char] Integer (Integer,Integer) FamilyTree FamilyTree FamilyTree deriving(Show, Ord, Eq)


familytree :: [String] -> [Integer] -> [(Integer, Integer)] -> FamilyTree --that it will take list of strings and integers and tuples and return a tree from type FamilyTree
familytree [] [] [] = EmptyTree--if the lists are empty that means there is no tree so we refere to EmptyTree
familytree (name : names) (numChildren : children) ((birth, death) : dates)-- defining the input for the familytree function.
  | numChildren > 3 = error "A parent can have at most three children, check your input please"--if number of children is bigger than three, that will violate the rule for my tri-array that i am creating( still if it was [familytree] it would be easier)
  | otherwise = Node name numChildren (birth, death) leftTree middleTree rightTree--in this case we will call the tree with the first thing of the lists and we call three subfunctions to help to build the tree.
  where--for this part I am using take and drop that I make sure I will use the number of children maximum 3 times.
    leftTree = familytree (take (fromIntegral numChildren) names) (take (fromIntegral numChildren) children) (take (fromIntegral numChildren) dates)
    middleTree = familytree (drop (fromIntegral numChildren) $ take (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) names) (drop (fromIntegral numChildren) $ take (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) children) (drop (fromIntegral numChildren) $ take (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) dates)
    rightTree = familytree (drop (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) names) (drop (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) children) (drop (2 * fromIntegral numChildren) dates)
