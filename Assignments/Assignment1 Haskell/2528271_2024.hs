-- I read and accept the submission rules and the extra rules specified 
--https://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers this is an extra resource that I used to learn, and the links provided at the end of the worksheets
--in each question. This is my own work that is done by myself only.

--type strong is provided for all functions for better understanding how to process during writing the function and what should be the output.


--data type that will represent the tree with infinite children that will be included in a list of trees
--each Node will store (name, employee) numberofchildren [children] and it goes like that
--or it will be Empty tree if there is no children
data UniTree = EmptyTree | Node ([Char] , Integer) Integer [UniTree]  deriving(Show, Ord, Eq)



-- unitree function
--a function to build the tree using a list of tuples and a list of integers for children.
unitree :: [(String, Integer)] -> [Integer] -> UniTree-- it will take a list of tuples represented as (string, int) and another int as parameter and return Unitree data type
unitree [] _ = EmptyTree -- if the list of tuples is empty
unitree _ []= EmptyTree-- if the children list is empty
unitree ((name, emp):restnames) (numchildren:restchildren) | numchildren>0 = Node (name, emp) numchildren (helper restnames restchildren numchildren)--if the parent has children then we keep calling the helper function to add the children to the list.
														   | numchildren==0 = Node (name,emp) numchildren [EmptyTree] --if the parent doesn't have children that means we will just return the parent and ignore the rest of the list

-- Helper function
-- it has some condtions to check which statements to execute according to the given input.
-- It takes three parameters:
--
-- 1. List of tuples where each tuple contains a string (node name) and an integer (employee number).
-- 2. List of integers representing the number of children for each node.
-- 3. Integer representing the number of children for the previous node.
--
-- It returns a list of UniTree representing the children of a node.

--section size function: which will mainly use map to use the function on the entire children list.

--manage entity function: which will mainly flatten the lists to be able to check the parent.

--helper function
-- It takes three parameters:
-- 1. String representing the parent's name.
